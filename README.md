# Semantic_Segmentation

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for semantic image segmentation using a pretrained UNet architecture. The workflow includes:

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Integration of helper utilities and segmentation libraries

Use of VGG-based UNet models for mask prediction

Visualization of segmentation outputs

The code is modular and extensible, designed to adapt across various image domains. All organizational or proprietary details have been excluded to preserve confidentiality.
